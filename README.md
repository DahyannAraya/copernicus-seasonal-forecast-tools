This repository hosts the **copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools**, a Python package developed to manage seasonal forecast data from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) as part of the [U-CLIMADAPT project](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/user-uptake/details/responding-to-the-impact-of-climate-change-u-climadapt-488).

It offers comprehensive tools for downloading, processing, computing climate indices, and generating hazard objects based on seasonal forecast datasets, particularly [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview).
The packge is tailored to integrate seamlessly with the [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/) (CLIMate ADAptation) platform, supporting climate risk assessment and the development of effective adaptation strategies.

Users can:
- Automatically download of high-resolution seasonal forecast data via the CDS API
- Preprocess sub-daily fields into daily aggregates
- Compute heat-related indices (e.g., **heatwave days**, **tropical nights**, **TX30**)
- Generate **CLIMADA hazard objects**
- Benefit from the modular design for extending to new indices or forecast products


## **Documentation**
For full documentation of all features and functions, please refer to the [Copernicus Seasonal Forecast Tools documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).


## **Getting Started**

To use this package, you must first configure access to the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu), which provides the seasonal forecast datasets.

We've prepared a comprehensive [CDS API setup guide](https://copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cds_api.html) to walk you through each step of the process. Once configured, you'll be ready to explore and analyze seasonal forecast data.


## **Installation**

The package requires **Python 3.10**, but versions 3.11 and 3.12 are also supported. Make sure your environment is using a compatible Python version before installation.

You can install **`copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools`** in three ways, depending on your setup and preferences.

> **Note:** If you want to generate CLIMADA hazard objects, you must install the **optional CLIMADA dependency**.  
> For full installation instructions, see the [online documentation](https://copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


### 1. Install via pip (recommended for most users)

```bash
pip install copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools
git clone https://github.com/DahyannAraya/copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.git (optional)
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt (optional)
```
### 2. Install via environment.yml (Conda or Mamba):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DahyannAraya/copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.git
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate venv_forecast
```
### 3. Install directly from GitHub 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DahyannAraya/copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools.git
cd copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools
pip install .
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt (optional)
```


### **CLIMADA Installation**

CLIMADA is required to generate hazard layers.

- If you installed via `environment.yml`, CLIMADA is already included.
- If you installed from PyPI and then ran `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`, CLIMADA is also installed.

> **Note**  
> If you want to have all the functionalities of **CLIMADA**, you must install the full version.  
> 👉 For detailed instructions, follow the official CLIMADA installation guide:  
> [CLIMADA Installation Guide](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/install.html)


## **Example of use**

This section provides practical example to help users understand how to work with the copernicus-seasonal-forecast-tools package. The notebooks demonstrate key steps including downloading data, computing climate indices, and generating CLIMADA hazard objects.

- **DEMO_copernicus_forecast_seasonal.ipynb**: This is the first notebook to run. It demonstrates how to install and use the `seasonal_forecast_tools` to download, process, and convert seasonal forecast data into a CLIMADA hazard object.
